To understand the program:
    Head towards "RAPPORT" and read the "PDF" file.



#--------------------main------------------#
Compile using the Makefile.
A folder containing test files is provided under the name:
f_test
A bash script that runs a suite of tests is provided under the name:
testeur.sh
Do not forget to grant execution permission to the file with the command:
chmod +x testeur.sh
You can run the tests using the command:
./testeur.sh
Otherwise, it is always possible to run unit tests with:
./main path_to_file/file
There is also an attached PDF document explaining in more detail the interpreted language and its grammar.
#--------------------secondary------------------#
The debug.c file contains a binary integer.
If it is set to true, debug output will be enabled.
The erreur_lecteur file is used to return possible errors.
Some modules from the course have been reused.
The source files that start with test were used during the implementation of the code to test certain modules.
